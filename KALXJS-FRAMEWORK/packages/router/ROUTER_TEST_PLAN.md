## Part 3: Test Environment Setup

### Testing Stack

- **Browser**: Chromium via Playwright
- **Dev Server**: Vite running simplified-test-app
- **Framework**: KALXJS with Router package
- **Test Runner**: Playwright with custom scripts

### Setup Instructions

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
cd c:\Users\kalculusGuy\Desktop\projectEra\nodejs\kalxjs\simplified-test-app
npm install

# 2. Start dev server (in separate terminal)
npm run dev

# 3. Run tests (once server is running)
npm run test:router
```

### Test App Routes

The simplified-test-app should have these routes for testing:

```javascript
const routes = [
  { path: '/', component: Home, name: 'Home' },
  { path: '/about', component: About, name: 'About' },
  { path: '/user/:id', component: UserDetail, name: 'UserDetail' },
  { path: '/posts', component: Posts, name: 'Posts' },
  { path: '/posts/:postId', component: PostDetail, name: 'PostDetail' },
  { path: '/settings', component: Settings, name: 'Settings' },
  { path: '/:pathMatch(.*)*', component: NotFound, name: 'NotFound' }
]
```

## Part 4: Known Issues & Fixes Applied

### Issue #1: 404 Error When Clicking Home Button on Home Page ✅ FIXED

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED in router v2.0.32

**Root Cause**: Global click handler was removing base path "/" entirely when navigating to root, resulting in empty string passed to router matching the catchall 404 route.

**Code Location**: `packages/router/src/index.js` lines 1028-1036

**Fix Applied**:
```javascript
// BEFORE (buggy):
if (base && path.startsWith(base)) {
  path = path.slice(base.length);  // "/" - "/" = "" (EMPTY!)
}

// AFTER (fixed):
if (base && base !== '/' && path.startsWith(base)) {
  path = path.slice(base.length);  // Now "/" is preserved
}
if (!path) {
  path = '/'  // Safety fallback
}
```

**Test Coverage**: Phase 2, Test 1 - "Clicking links" specifically tests this scenario
