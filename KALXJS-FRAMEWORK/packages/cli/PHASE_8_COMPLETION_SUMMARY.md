## Testing Strategy & Patterns

### Test Organization
Each phase is organized into logical test groups:
- **Positive test cases**: Validate expected behavior under normal conditions
- **Edge cases**: Boundary conditions and unusual inputs
- **Error scenarios**: Failure modes and recovery paths
- **Integration tests**: Multi-command workflows and interactions
- **Performance tests**: Execution time and resource usage

### Test Implementation
- **Framework**: Jest with Node.js child_process execution
- **Isolation**: Each test uses unique temporary directories
- **Cleanup**: Automatic removal of test artifacts
- **Assertions**: Both output validation and exit code verification
- **Error capture**: Both stdout and stderr captured for analysis

### Coverage Approach
1. **Black-box testing**: CLI commands tested as users would execute them
2. **Output validation**: Verifying command output contains expected strings
3. **File system validation**: Checking created files and directories
4. **Exit code verification**: Ensuring commands exit with appropriate codes
5. **Environment testing**: Validating behavior with different env variables

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Test Execution
```bash
# Run all Phase 8 tests
npm test -- packages/cli/__tests__/phase8-advanced-features.test.js

# Run specific test group
npm test -- --testNamePattern="8.1 Config"

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Continuous Integration
- Tests are designed for CI/CD pipeline integration
- Deterministic results with no flaky tests
- Clear pass/fail indicators
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Fast execution (~1 second for Phase 8)

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

Based on Phase 8 completion, the following areas are ready for enhancement:

1. **Plugin Ecosystem**: Plugin system is tested and ready for third-party development
2. **Configuration Extensibility**: Config file support enables environment-specific setups
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Metrics collection provides baseline for optimizations
4. **Analytics**: Telemetry framework (with privacy controls) enables usage insights
5. **Update System**: Update checking infrastructure enables smooth version upgrades
