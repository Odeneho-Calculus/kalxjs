Additional Bug Report for KalxJS Framework - Store Implementation
Summary
In addition to the AI module issues previously reported, there are significant problems with the store implementation in KalxJS.These issues cause runtime errors and make the store functionality unusable without manual fixes.

Detailed Issues and Recommended Fixes
1. Duplicate Import Declarations in Store Module
Issue: The useStore.js file contained duplicate import declarations for createStore, causing syntax errors that prevent the application from running.

    Location:

@kalxjs/core or custom store implementation in user applications
Example of problematic code:

import { createStore } from '@kalxjs/core';
// ... some code ...
import { createStore } from '@kalxjs/core'; // Duplicate import
Recommended Fix:

Review all framework files for duplicate imports
Implement linting in the build process to catch duplicate imports
Ensure that generated code or templates don't introduce duplicate imports
Consider using named imports with aliases if the same function needs to be imported from different sources:
import { createStore as coreCreateStore } from '@kalxjs/core';
import { createStore as customCreateStore } from './customStore';
2. Inconsistent Store API Implementation
Issue: The store implementation appears to have inconsistencies between how it's defined and how it's expected to be used in applications.

Recommended Fix:

Standardize the store API across the framework:
// Clear, consistent API pattern
export function useStore(options = {}) {
    // Implementation
    return {
        state,
        getters,
        actions,
        // Other store methods
    };
}
Provide TypeScript definitions for the store API to make usage clearer
Add comprehensive documentation on store usage patterns
3. Potential Circular Dependencies
Issue: The structure of the store implementation suggests potential circular dependencies that could cause initialization problems.

Recommended Fix:

Review the dependency graph of the store implementation
Refactor to avoid circular dependencies:
// Instead of direct imports between modules that reference each other
// Use a central registry or dependency injection pattern
const storeRegistry = {};

export function registerStore(name, store) {
    storeRegistry[name] = store;
}

export function getStore(name) {
    return storeRegistry[name];
}
4. Lack of Error Handling in Store Operations
Issue: The store implementation appears to lack proper error handling, which can lead to cryptic errors when store operations fail.

Recommended Fix:

Add proper error handling for common store operations:
    export function useStore(options = {}) {
        try {
            // Store initialization
            return store;
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Failed to initialize store:', error);
            // Provide fallback or throw a more descriptive error
            throw new Error(`Store initialization failed: ${error.message}`);
        }
    }
Implement validation for store configuration options
Add debugging helpers for store - related issues
5. Inconsistent Module Resolution
Issue: The framework appears to have inconsistencies in how modules are resolved, particularly when mixing default and named exports.

Recommended Fix:

Standardize the export pattern across the framework:
// Either use named exports consistently
export const createStore = () => { /* implementation */ };
export const useStore = () => { /* implementation */ };

// Or use default exports consistently
const storeModule = {
    createStore: () => { /* implementation */ },
    useStore: () => { /* implementation */ }
};
export default storeModule;
Ensure documentation and examples match the actual export structure
Consider providing both named and default exports with clear documentation on which to use
Overall Framework Recommendations
Based on the issues encountered with both the AI and store modules, here are some general recommendations for improving the KalxJS framework:

Comprehensive Testing Suite:

Implement end - to - end tests that verify the framework works in real applications
Test with different bundlers and environments
Add integration tests for common usage patterns
Improved Error Messages:

Add descriptive error messages that help developers identify and fix issues
Include debugging information in development mode
Provide links to documentation for common errors
Consistent API Design:

Review the entire API surface for consistency
Standardize naming conventions and patterns
Document breaking changes clearly
Developer Tools:

Create developer tools to help debug KalxJS applications
Add logging options for development environments
Consider a browser extension for debugging
Documentation Overhaul:

Update all documentation to match the actual implementation
Add more examples covering common use cases
Create troubleshooting guides for common issues
