   if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
     createDevTools({
       enabled: true,
       inspector: true,
       profiler: true
     });
   }
   ```

2. **Open Chrome DevTools** (F12) on any page using KALXJS

3. **Navigate to the "KALXJS" panel** in DevTools

4. **Start debugging** with comprehensive insights into your application

## Development

### Requirements
- Node.js 18+
- Chrome 88+ (for Manifest V3 support)

### Build Scripts
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Development build with watch mode
pnpm run dev

# Production build
pnpm run build:prod

# Create distributable package
pnpm run package

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Lint code
pnpm run lint

#Extra
rm -r build dist 2>/dev/null; echo "Cleaned build and dist directories"

```

### Project Structure

scripts/                # Build and packaging scripts
tests/                  # Test files
```

### Architecture

The extension uses a multi-context architecture:
- **Background Service Worker**: Manages extension lifecycle and tab communication
- **Content Script**: Bridges between page and extension contexts
- **Injected Script**: Runs in page context for direct framework access
- **DevTools Panel**: Provides the debugging interface

Communication flows securely between contexts using Chrome's message passing APIs with comprehensive error handling and performance monitoring.

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: v88+ (Primary target)
- **Edge**: v88+ (Chromium-based)
- **Firefox**: v109+ (With compatibility layer)
- **Other Chromium browsers**: Brave, Opera, Arc
