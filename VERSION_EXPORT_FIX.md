# KALXJS Version Export Fix

This document outlines the changes made to fix the version export issue in the KALXJS framework.

## Problem

The application was encountering the following error:

```
Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module 'http://localhost:3000/node_modules/.vite/deps/@kalxjs_core.js?v=91e43cb4' doesn't provide an export named: 'version'
```

This error occurred because the main.js file was trying to import a `version` export from the `@kalxjs/core` module, but this export didn't exist in the module.

## Solution

### 1. Added version export to @kalxjs/core

We added a direct export of the version constant in the core module:

```javascript
// Export version directly
export const version = '2.2.1';
```

This ensures that the version can be imported directly from the core module.

### 2. Updated version consistency

We made sure the version in the code matches the version in package.json:

- Updated the version in the kalxjs object to match the package.json version
- Exported the version directly to make it available for imports

### 3. Fixed version handling in generated files

We updated the template files to handle version imports more robustly:

- Changed the router and state modules to define version constants instead of exporting them
- Updated the main.js file to use hardcoded version constants instead of imports
- Added error handling for version compatibility checks
- Added fallbacks for missing version information

### 4. Improved error handling

We enhanced the error handling in the version compatibility check to:

- Handle missing version information gracefully
- Provide meaningful warnings when versions are incompatible
- Continue execution even when version checks fail

## Files Modified

1. `KALXJS-FRAMEWORK/packages/core/src/index.js`
   - Added direct version export
   - Updated version number to match package.json

2. `KALXJS-FRAMEWORK/packages/cli/src/commands/create.js`
   - Updated main.js template to use constants instead of imports
   - Updated router and state module templates to define versions instead of exporting them
   - Improved version compatibility check with better error handling

## Testing

After making these changes, the application should no longer encounter the version export error. The framework now:

1. Properly exports the version from the core module
2. Uses hardcoded version constants in generated files
3. Handles missing or incompatible versions gracefully

## Future Considerations

For future versions of the framework, consider:

1. Standardizing version exports across all modules
2. Adding a centralized version management system
3. Implementing automatic version compatibility checks during installation
