# Introduction to kalxjs

Welcome to kalxjs! This guide will introduce you to the core concepts and features of the framework.

## What is kalxjs?

kalxjs is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Unlike monolithic frameworks, kalxjs is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library focuses on the view layer only, making it easy to integrate with other libraries or existing projects.

At the same time, kalxjs is perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

## Core Features

### Reactive Data Binding

At the heart of kalxjs is a reactive data binding system. When you modify your application's data, the view automatically updates to reflect those changes.

```javascript
import { reactive } from 'kalxjs';

const state = reactive({
  message: 'Hello kalxjs'
});

// Later, when this changes...
state.message = 'Welcome to kalxjs';
// ...the UI automatically updates!
```

### Component-Based Architecture

kalxjs applications are built by composing components. Components encapsulate data, logic, and the user interface, making your code more maintainable and reusable.

```javascript
import { defineComponent, h } from 'kalxjs';

const Button = defineComponent({
  props: {
    label: String,
    primary: Boolean
  },
  render() {
    return h('button', {
      class: this.primary ? 'btn-primary' : 'btn-default',
      onClick: () => this.$emit('click')
    }, this.label);
  }
});
```

### Virtual DOM

kalxjs uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance. Instead of directly manipulating the browser's DOM for every change, kalxjs creates a lightweight copy of the DOM in memory. It then efficiently compares the virtual DOM with the actual DOM and makes only the minimum changes needed.

### State Management

For larger applications, kalxjs provides a centralized state management solution inspired by Flux architecture. This makes it easier to manage shared state across components.

```javascript
import { createStore } from 'kalxjs/state';

const store = createStore({
  state: {
    count: 0
  },
  mutations: {
    increment(state) {
      state.count++;
    }
  }
});
```

### Routing

kalxjs includes a powerful routing system for creating single-page applications with dynamic navigation.

```javascript
import { createRouter } from 'kalxjs/router';

const router = createRouter({
  routes: [
    { path: '/', component: Home },
    { path: '/about', component: About },
    { path: '/user/:id', component: User }
  ]
});
```

## Philosophy

kalxjs is built with the following principles in mind:

1. **Simplicity**: We strive to create an API that's easy to learn and use.
2. **Performance**: kalxjs is optimized for speed and efficiency.
3. **Flexibility**: The framework can be used for simple websites or complex applications.
4. **Progressive**: You can adopt kalxjs incrementally, starting with just the core and adding features as needed.
